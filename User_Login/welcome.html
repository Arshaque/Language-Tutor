      <li>The C programming language is a structure oriented programming language, developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie</li>
      <li>C programming language features were derived from an earlier language called &ldquo;B&rdquo; (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL)</li>
      <li>C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system</li>
      <li>In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition  &ldquo;The C Programming Language&rdquo; and commonly known as K&amp;R C</li>
      <li>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or &ldquo;ANSI C&rdquo;, was completed late 1988.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>C programming language standards:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>C89/C90 standard – First standardized specification for C language was developed by the American National Standards Institute in 1989. C89 and C90 standards refer to the same programming language.</li>
      <li>C99 standard – Next revision was published in 1999 that introduced new features like advanced data types and other changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>C11 and Embedded C language:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>C11 standard adds new features to C programming language and library like type generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading and bounds-checked functions. It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional and improves compatibility with C++.</li>
      <li>Embedded C includes features not available in C like fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing.</li>
      <li>Operating systems, C compiler and all UNIX application programs are written in C language</li>
      <li>It is also called as procedure oriented programming language. The C language is reliable, simple and easy to use. C has been coded in assembly language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features of C programming language:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliability</li>
      <li>Portability</li>
      <li>Flexibility</li>
      <li>Interactivity</li>
      <li>Modularity</li>
      <li>Efficiency and Effectiveness</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Uses of C programming language:</h3>
    <p>The C programming language is used for developing system applications that forms a major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux. Below are some examples of C being used.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Database systems</li>
      <li>Graphics packages</li>
      <li>Word processors</li>
      <li>Spreadsheets</li>
      <li>Operating system development</li>
      <li>Compilers and Assemblers</li>
      <li>Network drivers</li>
      <li>Interpreters</li>
    </ul>
